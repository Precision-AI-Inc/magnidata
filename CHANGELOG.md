# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- Build a dataset from a server-side folder in `image_sets/`: drop a folder holding
  `images/` (and optionally matching COCO `labels/`) on the host, and prepare it from
  the portal's "Bring Your Own Data" dialog. The folders are indexed by
  `GET /api/datasets/build/local-folders`, and the build runs in place — no upload, no
  copy of the image data, and none of the browser-upload size caps.
- Initial release: the `precisionai.magnidata` visual-query dashboard — a deterministic
  feature-extraction/embeddings toolkit (`tools/`), a Flask API (`api/`), a React/Vite/
  Three.js dashboard (`dashboard/`), and Docker Compose deployment.

### Changed

- Renamed the project to MagniData throughout: the distribution is now `magnidata`
  (was `pai-dataviz`), the import path is `precisionai.magnidata` (was
  `precisionai.dataviz`), and the Compose project/containers are `magnidata-*`. The
  `dataviz-features/…` and `dataviz-embeddings/…` feature-schema identifiers are
  deliberately unchanged — they are a data contract recorded in provenance sidecars, so
  renaming them would misreport the schema version of already-generated datasets.

### Fixed

- Portal served a blank page after a rebuild: `index.html` is now sent with
  `Cache-Control: no-cache` and missing `/assets/` bundles return 404 instead of
  falling back to `index.html`, which browsers refused to execute as a module script.
